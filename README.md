In this repository, I share Python codes that handle FATSQ/FASTA files in super custom ways.

1. Random_Seq_Generator.py
This script generates random DNA sequences with equal proportions for each nucleotide.

2. nuc_repetition_filtering.py
This script gets a FASTA file as input and filters out sequences that contain any 3N (AAA, TTT, GGG, or CCC) repetition.
